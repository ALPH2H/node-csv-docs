# Stream Transform examples

This package proposes different API flavours. Every example is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/adaltas/node-stream-transform/tree/master/samples).

For additional usages and examples, you may refer to:

* [the API page](/transform/api/)
* [the "samples" folder](https://github.com/adaltas/node-stream-transform/tree/master/samples)
* [the "test" folder](https://github.com/adaltas/node-stream-transform/tree/master/test).

## Mixing the stream and callback APIs

The [output stream example](https://github.com/adaltas/node-csv/blob/master/packages/stream-transform/samples/mixed.output_stream.js) send the data in the form of a string and read the resulted dataset as a stream.
